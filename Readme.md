## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

The mcopy project is comprised of software and hardware for optical printers, built with repurposed broken projectors.



#### Components

* Sequencer desktop app
* Scripting language, called mscript, for complex sequences
* Arduino firmware for projectors, cameras, lights and existing printers
* 3D models of parts

## Software <a name="software"></a>

The mcopy desktop app is an Electron-based project which can be built for any platform.


## Hardware <a name="hardware"></a>



## Why? <a name="why"></a>

I'm interested in expanding the viability and access of the 16mm film format and to repurpose thre rising tide of discarded film technology.
